Hi! Iâ€™m Abdullah Nazmus-Sakib, 
currently a third-year student at Jahangirnagar University, 
studying in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. 
I hail from Bagmara, Rajshahi, and my goal is to become a proficient software engineer.

To achieve this, I am about to begin a course with Bongodev, 
which will help me to enhance my skills and better prepare for job opportunities in the near future.
